This is project focuses on leveraging SQL's capabilities to perform efficient data retrieval and aggregation from a structured database representing real food delivery scenarios. By applying advanced SQL queries, the project can explore critical factors such as order volumes, customer behavior, delivery times, popular cuisines, and restaurant performance. These queries help uncover trends and potential areas of improvement in the delivery process.

Complementing SQL, Python is used for preprocessing the data to enhance the performance of subsequent analysis steps. This preprocessing may involve cleaning, transformation, and optimization of the dataset, ensuring that SQL operations run smoothly and efficiently. The use of Jupyter Notebooks indicates an interactive environment where data analysis and visualization can be integrated seamlessly, fostering a better understanding of the data’s narrative.

The project’s real strength lies in combining database management and programming techniques to tackle practical problems in the food delivery domain. It covers essential topics such as database handling, data analytics, and performance tuning. Although the database system primarily used seems to be PostgreSQL, the skills and techniques adopted here are transferable to other relational databases like MySQL or SQL Server.

By working on this project, users are exposed to real-world dataset challenges such as handling missing values, optimizing query performance, and generating actionable business insights. The project is suitable for those who want to build expertise in SQL-based data analysis, database management, and Python data manipulation, particularly in the context of food delivery services.
